        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So I've got the bare minimum set up for this journal, in the [thinking-aloud][thinking-aloud] repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>issues to contain my journal entries, and possibly conversations about them (via the comments)</li>
<li>a simple <a href="https://github.com/qmacro/thinking-aloud/blob/main/feed">Atom feed generator</a> that will build an Atom 1.0 feed from a JSON list of issues that I can retrieve from the GitHub API - the feed's URL is <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qmacro/thinking-aloud/main/feed.xml">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qmacro/thinking-aloud/main/feed.xml</a></li>
<li>labels that I can assign to the issues for eventual categorisation (I have <a href="https://github.com/qmacro/thinking-aloud/blob/08bf3f98064237c35b3bf7ae4fb16b5ecb9608b6/feed#L44">made provision for this in the feed generator already</a></li>
<li>a GitHub Actions <a href="https://github.com/qmacro/thinking-aloud/actions/workflows/generate-feed.yml">workflow</a> that is triggered when an issue is created or edited and causes the feed to be rebuilt</li>
</ul>
<p>This was a pleasant few hours messing around on a day off. Well, I say pleasant, there was one unpleasant part which was trying (and failing) to parse and use the output from the <a href="https://github.com/octokit/request-action">octokit/request-action</a>.</p>
<p>The silver lining in this though is that I realised that I could just use the <code>gh</code> CLI, as long as I supply the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> env var with the appropriate (and auto-generated) secret value, <a href="https://github.com/qmacro/thinking-aloud/blob/a8fda4c7705d26a30d47001885e6f20d4669a987/.github/workflows/generate-feed.yml#L21-L27">like this</a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in following these journal entries, add the feed URL to your favourite feed reader: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qmacro/thinking-aloud/main/feed.xml">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qmacro/thinking-aloud/main/feed.xml</a>, and if you want to comment on any of the entries, you can do so in the comments to the corresponding issue.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Can't help overthinking what I should have as my first entry in this journal. Reminds me of the feeling of starting a new notebook, and agonising over what should be on the first page - it must be neat and permanently relevant. Of course, that's nonsense.</p>
<p>So I thought I'd just start typing. After all, the idea of this journal is to allow me to record thoughts in as friction-free a way as possible. Part of that is having a low barrier to writing, but also a low filter threshold.</p>
<p>Anyway, as usual, I've spent the last hour yak shaving, setting up a little system where I can just hit <code>j</code> and get directly to typing in my thoughts.</p>
<p>Hitting <code>j</code> starts a new <code>tmux</code> 'JOURNAL' session, or attaches to an existing one, and then uses <code>gh issue create</code> to initiate the process. The title is easy - I wanted to avoid having to think about what I should title each journal entry, so I'm simply using a timestamp. The <code>gh issue create</code> process then takes me into <code>vim</code> whereupon some <code>vim</code> configuration notices that it's a Markdown buffer that I'm editing, and throws me into <code>Goyo</code> which is a fantastic way to focus on writing.</p>
<p>And that's it. I'm not exactly sure whether things will work when I exit this buffer, I guess the only way to find out is to try it. Here goes.</p>]]></content>
